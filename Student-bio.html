		<p>
			My name is Christopher Clark. I'm a stay-at-home dad with two children, Caleb (Age 5) and Alana (Age 3). I have always loved coding as a hobby, and so I thought it would be a good idea to re-train as a software developer as I attempt to re-enter the workforce. I have previous experience in the software industry doing Quality Assurance and Product Management.
